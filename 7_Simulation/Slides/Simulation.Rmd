# Review: Statistical distributions

## Statistical distributions

Recall from your previous statistics classes...

- A **random variable** is a value we don't know until we take a **sample**.
    + Coin flip:  Could be heads (0) or tails (1)
    + Person's height:  Could be anything from 0 feet to 20 feet.
    + Annual income of a US worker:  $0 to $1.6 billion
    
--

- The **distribution** of the random variable tells us the **possible values** and **how likely they are**
    + Coin flip has 50% chance of heads, 50% chance of tails
    + Likelihood of heights follow a bell curve shape around 5 foot 7.
    + Most American workers make under $100,000

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Images", "other", "men_women_height_histogram.jpg"))
```

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Images", "other", "income.png"))
```

---
## Statistical distributions

Some distributions have names.  

For this class, you need to know a few of them.

--
    + Uniform
    + Normal
    + t-distribution
    + Binomial
    + Chi-Square

---
# Uniform

When you know the **range**, but not much else.

All values in the range are **equally likely** to occur.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="40%"}
my_samples <- data.frame(x = runif(1000))

ggplot(my_samples, aes(x)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 40, aes(y = ..density..), fill = "grey", col = "white") + 
  stat_function(fun=dunif, col = "cornflowerblue", lwd = 2) +
  theme_classic()
```
---
# Normal

When you expect values to fall **near the center**.

Frequency of values follows a **bell curve** shape.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="40%"}
my_samples <- data.frame(x = rnorm(1000))

ggplot(my_samples, aes(x)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 40, aes(y = ..density..), fill = "grey", col = "white") + 
  stat_function(fun=dnorm, col = "cornflowerblue", lwd = 2) +
  theme_classic()
```

---
# t-Distribution

Slightly **wider bell curve** shape.

Basically, the same context as the **Normal distribution**, but used more often in 
real data.  (When the *standard deviation* is unknown.)

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="40%"}
my_samples <- data.frame(x = rt(1000, df = 5))

ggplot(my_samples, aes(x)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 40, aes(y = ..density..), fill = "grey", col = "white") + 
  stat_function(fun= function(x) dt(x, df = 5), col = "cornflowerblue", lwd = 2) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, col = "indianred", lwd = 1) +
  theme_classic()
```
---
# Chi-Square Distribution

Somewhat **skewed**, and only allows values **above zero**.

Used in testing **count data**.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="40%"}
my_samples <- data.frame(x = rchisq(1000, df = 5))

ggplot(my_samples, aes(x)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 40, aes(y = ..density..), fill = "grey", col = "white") + 
  stat_function(fun= function(x) dchisq(x, df = 5), col = "cornflowerblue", lwd = 2) +
  theme_classic()
```

---
# Binomial

Appears when you have **two possible outcomes**, and you are **counting**
how many times each outcome occurred.

(Common example: voting data)

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="40%"}
my_samples <- data.frame(x = rbinom(1000, 10, .8))

ggplot(my_samples, aes(x)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "grey", col = "white") + 
  theme_classic()
```
---
# Statistical Distributions

Things you might want to use a Statistical distribution for:

--

* Find the **probability** of an **event**
     + If I flip 10 coins, what are the chances I get all heads?
     
--

* Estimate a **percentage** of a **population**:
    + About what percent of people are above 6 feet tall?
    
--

* Quantify the **evidence** in your **data**:
    + In my survey of 100 people, 67 said they were voting for Measure A.  How
    confident am I that Measure A will pass?

# Statistical distributions in R

## Simulate observations
## Make the computer do the math


---
## Distributions in R

- `r` stands for for **random sampling**: generate a random value from the
distribution

--

- We typically use this to **simulate** date; that is, to generate pretend observations
to see what happens.

---
## Random Sampling

```{r}
runif(3)
runif(3, min = 10, max = 20)

rnorm(3)
rnorm(3, mean = -100, sd = 50)


```

---
## Random Sampling

```{r}

rt(3, df = 11)

rbinom(3, size = 10, prob = 0.7)

rchisq(3, df = 11)
```

---

## Distributions in R

- `p` for **probability**: i.e. compute the chances of an observation less than `x`

--

- We usually use this for calculating **p-values**

---
# Probabilities

```{r}
pnorm(1.5)
pnorm(70, mean = 67, sd = 3)

1 - pnorm(70, mean = 67, sd = 3)
```

---
## Try it!

- What is the probability that a Chi-Square distribution with 35 degrees of freedom gives a value of 25 or less?


- What is the probability that 10 coin tosses give 6 or more heads?

---
## Try it!

- What is the probability that a Chi-Square distribution with 35 degrees of freedom gives a value of 25 or less?

```{r}
pchisq(25, df = 35)
```



- What is the probability that 10 coin tosses give 6 or more heads?

```{r}
1 - pbinom(5, size = 10, prob = 0.5)
```


---
## Distributions in R

- `q` stands for **quantile**: given a probability p, compute the x-value
such that P(X < x) = p.

- the `q` functions are the "backwards" version of the `p` functions

--

- We don't use this very often

---
# Quantiles

```{r}
qnorm(.95)
qnorm(.95, mean = 67, sd = 3)
```

---
## Try it!

- If I randomly sample a number between 16 and 22, I can be 80% sure my number will be less than what?

- What is the critical value for a 1-sided t-test at the 0.05 significance level, with a sample size of 50?

---
## Try it!

- If I uniformly sample a number between 16 and 22, I can be 80% sure my number will be less than what?

```{r}
qunif(.80, min = 16, max = 22)
```


- What is the critical value for a 1-sided t-test at the 0.05 significance level, with a sample size of 50?

```{r}
qt(.05, df = 50)
```


---
## Distributions in R

`d` stands for **density**: compute the height of distribution curve

--
* **Discrete** distributions: probability of getting that **exact value**

* **Continuous** distributions: usually meaningless

---
## Try it

What is the probability of getting exactly 12 heads in 20 coin tosses, for a
coin with a 70% chance of tails?

---

## Try it

What is the probability of getting exactly 12 heads in 20 coin tosses, for a
coin with a 70% chance of tails?

```{r}
dbinom(12, size = 20, prob = .3)
```
