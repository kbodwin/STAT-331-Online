# Regular Expressions

A **regular expression** is a way of "fuzzy matching" text.

```{r}
my_str <- c("Kelly", "Jelly", "Belly", "Smelly") 

str_subset(my_str, "Kelly")

```

--

```{r}

str_subset(my_str, ".elly")

```

--

```{r}

str_subset(my_str, "[A-z]+elly")

```

---
# Regular Expressions


```{r}
my_str <- c("Kelly", "Hi Kelly", "Kelly Bodwin", "Who is Kelly?")

str_subset(my_str, "Kelly")

```

```{r}

str_subset(my_str, "Kelly?")

```

```{r}

str_subset(my_str, "Kelly\\?")

```

---
# Regular Expressions

* Letters and numbers match themselves

* `[A-Z]` matches any *capital* letter.

* `[a-z]` matches any *lowercase* letter.

* `[A-z]` or `[:alpha:]` matches *any* letter

*  `[0-9]` or `[:digit:]` matches any *number*

*  See the `stringr` cheatsheet for more shortcuts, like `[:punct:]`

---
# Regular Expressions

* `.` matches any character at all (except new lines)

* `?` means "the thing before me, 0 or 1 times"

* `{2}` means "the thing before me, repeated exactly twice.

* `+` means "the thing before me, repeated 1 to infinity times."

* `*` means "the thing before me, repeated 0 to infinity times."

* "escape" a special character with `\\` to match the literal character

---
# Escaping a character


```{r}
my_str <- c("Kelly", "Hi Kelly", "Kelly Bodwin", "Who is Kelly?")

str_subset(my_str, "Kelly")

```

```{r}

str_subset(my_str, "Kelly?")

```

```{r}

str_subset(my_str, "Kelly\\?")

```


---
# Repeated Characters

```{r}
my_str <- c("Key", "Kely", "Kelly", "Kellly", "Kelllllly")

```

--

```{r}
str_subset(my_str, "Kel{2}y")
```

--

```{r}
str_subset(my_str, "Kel+y")
```

--

```{r}
str_subset(my_str, "Kel*y")
```

# Tip 1:
## Read the regular expressions out loud like a "request"

---
# Quick Quiz

What will this code return?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_str <- c("Key", "Kely", "Kelly", "Kellly", "Kelllllly")

str_subset(my_str, "l{2}")
```

--

"Which elements contain, somewhere, exactly 2 l's?"

--
```{r, echo = FALSE}
str_subset(my_str, "l{2}")
```

---

# Quick Quiz

Based on what you've learned so far, what does `.*` match?

--

"Please give me any character (`.`), repeated 0 to infinity times `*`"

--

This matches **everything**!!!

--

This is a very common trick in regular expressions.

---
# Quick Quiz

What will this return?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_str <- c("Kelly", "Jelly and Peanut Butter", "Socks are smelly.", "Kelly is smelly", "Photosynthesis") 

str_extract(my_str, ".*lly")
str_extract(my_str, ".*lly")
str_extract_all(my_str, ".*lly")
```

--
```{r, echo = FALSE}
my_str <- c("Kelly", "Jelly and Peanut Butter", "Socks are smelly.", "Kelly is smelly", "Photosynthesis") 

str_extract(my_str, ".*lly")
str_extract(my_str, ".*lly")
str_extract_all(my_str, ".*lly")
```

---

# Tip 2:
## Use str_view() and str_view_all() to test out regular expressions on small examples

```{r}
str_view(my_str, ".*elly")
```


---
# Regular Expressions

* `^` matches the start of the string

```{r}
my_str <- c("Kelly", "Hi Kelly", "Kelly Bodwin", "Who is Kelly?")
str_subset(my_str, "^Kelly")
```

--

*Alert!** This doesn't match the start of a *word*.  It matches the start of the *character object*.

---
# Regular Expressions

* `$` matches the end of the string

```{r}
my_str <- c("Kelly", "Hi Kelly", "Kelly Bodwin", "Who is Kelly?")
str_subset(my_str, "Kelly$")
```

--

*Alert!** This doesn't match the end of a *word*.  It matches the end of the *character object*.



---

# Regular Expressions

* `()` groups things together
* `[]` is "match any of the characters in the box"

--

```{r}
my_str <- c("Kelly", "Kelkel")

str_subset(my_str, "([Kk]el){2}")
```

# Tip 3:

## I use the stringr cheatsheet more than any other, by a lot.

---
# Quick quiz

What will the following outputs be?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_str <- "The Dursleys of Number 4 Privet Drive were 
happy to say that they were perfectly 
normal, thank you very much."

str_extract_all(my_str, ".*")

str_extract_all(my_str, "\\w")

str_extract_all(my_str, "\\s")

str_extract_all(my_str, "[:alpha:]+")

str_extract_all(my_str, "[:alpha:]*\\.")

str_extract_all(my_str, "[wv]er[ey]")

```
---
# Harder quick quiz

What will the following outputs be?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_str <- "The Dursleys of Number 4 Privet Drive were 
happy to say that they were perfectly 
normal, thank you very much."

str_extract_all(my_str, "[:digit:] ([A-Z][a-z]*)+")

str_extract_all(my_str, "(?<=[:digit:] )[:alpha:]+")

str_extract_all(my_str, "[:digit:].*Drive")

my_str %>%
  str_split() %>%
  str_extract("^[A-Z]")
```

# Your Turn

The file `hamlet_speech.txt` contains the text of a famous speech from the play "Hamlet" by Shakespeare.  Download this file and save it somewhere reasonable.  Read it into R with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
hamlet <- readLines("hamlet_speech.txt")
```

# Your Turn

---
# Your Turn

Answer the following:

* How many words are in the speech?  (Hint: `str_count`)
* How many times does Hamlet reference death or dying?
* How many sentences are in the speech?
* What is the longest word in the speech?
* What is the only capitalized word that does not start a sentence or line?

--

*Hint:* Right now, your object is an *vector* of type *character*, where each element is a line of the speech.  You may want to use `str_c()` (with appropriate arguments) to turn this into a *single string*.  You may also want to turn it into a vector where each element is *one word*.

Or you may want to do all three!  Different tasks will be easier with different object structures.

# Tokenizing

<img src="tidytext.png" width=300>

---

# Converting text to data

We need to separate text into words and/or n-grams.  These are called **tokens**.

The package `tokenizers` makes this much easier.

```{r}
library(tokenizers)

hamlet %>%
  str_c(collapse = " ") %>%
  tokenize_words()
```

---

```{r}
hamlet %>%
  str_c(collapse = " ") %>%
  tokenize_ngrams(3)
```

# Sentiment analysis

A popular approach to text analysis to to analyze *sentiments*, or how positive/negative certain language is.

```{r}
library(tidytext)

positive <- get_sentiments("bing") %>%
  filter(sentiment == "positive")

positive
```

---
# Sentiment analysis

```{r}
hdf <- hamlet %>%
  str_c(collapse = " ") %>%
  tokenize_words() %>%
  data.frame()

names(hdf) <- "word"

```

---
# Sentiment analysis

```{r}
hdf %>%
  semi_join(positive) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

```

---
# Try it

* What is are most common **negative** words in Hamlet's speech?

---
# Flex Points

* (10 flex points) The full text of the play is available as `hamlet.txt`.  Use this to make a plot of sentiment by Act of the play.  You may find [this book](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) helpful.
