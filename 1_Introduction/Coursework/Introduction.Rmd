# Installing R and RStudio

---


## Install R

*If you already have R downloaded, please follow these steps anyways, to make sure
you have the most recent version of R.*

Download and install R by going to [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/).

If you are a **Windows** user: 

* Click on “Download R for Windows”

* Click on “base”

* Click on the Download link.


If you are a **Linux** user: 

Click on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup.


If you are **macOS** user: 

* Click on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”

* Under “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of June 22, 2020 was R-4.1.0.



#### Troubleshooting for Macs

First, identify which version of OSx you are running.  [How-to](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201260)

Next, find out which version of R your computer can run.  [Link](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)

If this version is 3.5 or later, download the latest version that your computer can handle.

If this version is 3.4 or earlier, you're going to run in to some trouble.  I recommend updating your version of OSx, if you are willing.  If you can't, then you can use [rstudio.cloud](rstudio.cloud) to run R and RStudio on a free server.  However, I recommend strongly against this option; your files will not be saved indefinitely, your computing power will be limited, and you will need an internet connection at all times to do your work.

## Install RStudio

RStudio can be downloaded [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

If you already have RStudio:

You **do not** need an update if your RStudio logo looks like this: <img src='../../Images/other/rs_icon_new.png' height='25' width='50'>

You **do** need an update if your RStudio logo looks like this: <img src='../../Images/other/rs_icon_old.png' height='25' width='25'>

## Install/update the tidyverse

In this class, we will make heavy use of the *tidyverse* suite of packages.

If you **have not** used the tidyverse before, type the following into your **console**:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

If you **have** used the tidyverse before, you only need to update packages.  
Type the following into your console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
tidyverse_update()
```

Then follow the instructions that print out to update a few of your tidyverse packages.

R Markdown documents more beautiful.

# Bringing it all together

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
checkin("R, RStudio, and R Markdown")
```

Correct the following sentences, so that they make sense.

1. "I wrote RStudio code to make a beautiful plot."

2. "I used Markdown to put R code in my report."

3. "I can't get R to open!"

4. "Can I send you my RStudio so you can check out if my R Markdown code is 
correct?  I can't get R to knit."
